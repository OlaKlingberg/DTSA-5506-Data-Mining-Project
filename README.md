# Vaccine Misinformation â€“ A Twitter Pandemic

## Background
This project was developed for the course *Data Mining Project* (DTSA-5506), at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Description
The project investigates the dissemination of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on Twitter (now renamed X) from December 1, 2020 till July 31, 2021.

## Data Source
The data comes from the study [ANTi-Vax: a novel Twitter dataset for COVID-19 vaccine misinformation detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621004534?via%3Dihub) and can be accessed from [github.com/sakibsh/ANTIVax](https://github.com/sakibsh/ANTiVax).

## Key features
* **Topic Modeling**: Applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to identify and compare prevalent topics in tweets containing misinformation versus those without.
* **Network Analysis**: Constructs and analyzes a network of the main spreaders of vaccine misinformation to understand their influence and reach.

## Key Results
* Among the takeways from the topic modeling were:
 * Out of the nine topics identified in the misinformation tweets, seven included *experimental* among their salient terms, indicating the degree to which the idea that the vaccines were experimental dominated the misinformation.
 * Out of the five topics identified in the tweets not containing misinformation, three had *worry* among their salient terms.
* The network analysis showed that 15 accounts together stood for just over 50% of the total misintormation impact represented in the dataset.
