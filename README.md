# Vaccine Misinformation – A Twitter Pandemic
Final project in the course *Data Mining Project* (DTSA-5506), at University of Colorado Boulder.

## ABSTRACT 
In this project, I investigate tweets containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. 

The project has two parts: 
* In the first part, I use topic modeling, a natural language processing technique, to extract the main topics making up this misinformation, and compare them to the topics in vaccine-related tweets that don’t contain misinformation.
* In the second part, I use network analysis to examine how and to what extent the main spreaders of vaccine misinformation are connected to each other through retweeting. I use a custom metric to compare how much each account contributes to the spread of the information, and I show that just 15 accounts are responsible for over 50% of the total spread. These insights are valuable when planning public-information campaigns and other measures to counter vaccine misinformation.
